    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Pontsho and I am currently enrolled in a web development
      bootcamp, where I am learning the fundamentals of building websites using
      HTML, CSS and other front-end tools. I have a strong interest in creating
      simple, user-friendly websites and continuously improving my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of web development, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and
      exploring creative ways to express ideas through design. My goal is to
      grow into a confident developer who can contribute to meaningful digital
      projects and continue learning along the way.
